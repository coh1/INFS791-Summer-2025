80||On these cards are some opinions about the government and the economy. For each one I'd like you to tell me whether you strongly agree, somewhat agree, somewhat disagree or strongly disagree.
80A|EQUAL1|In our society everyone must look out for himself. It is of little use to unite with others and fight for one's goals in politics or in unions.
80B|EQUAL2|The economy can run only if businessmen make good profits. That benefits everyone in the end.
80C|EQUAL3|The government must see to it that everyone has a job and that prices are stable, even if the rights of businessmen have to be restricted.
80D|EQUAL4|It is the responsibility of government to meet everyone's needs, even in case of sickness, poverty, unemployment, and old age.
80E|EQUAL5|If social welfare benefits such as disability, unemployment compensation, and early retirement pensions are as high as they are now, it only makes people not want to work anymore.
80F|EQUAL6|All in all, one can live well in America.
80G|EQUAL7|Generally speaking, business profits are distributed fairly in the United States.
80H|EQUAL8|If someone has a high social or economic position, that indicates the person has special abilities or great accomplishments.
81||Here are different opinions about social differences in this country. Please tell me for each one whether you strongly agree, somewhat, agree, somewhat disagree, or strongly disagree.
81A|USCLASS1|In the United States traditional divisions between owners and workers still remain. A person's social standing depends upon whether he/she belongs to the upper or lower class.
81B|USCLASS2|In the United States there are still great differences between social levels, and what one can achieve in life depends mainly upon one's family background.
81C|USCLASS3|America has an open society. What one achieves in life no longer depends on one's family background, but on the abilities one has and the education one acquires.
81D|USCLASS4|What one gets in life hardly depends at all on one's own efforts, but rather on the economic situation, job opportunities, union agreements, and the social services provided by the government.
81E|USCLASS5|Personal income should not be determined solely by one's work. Rather, everybody should get what he/she needs to provide a decent life for his/her family.
81F|USCLASS6|Only if differences in income and social standing are large enough is there an incentive for individual effort.
81G|USCLASS7|Differences in social standing between people are acceptable because they basically reflect what people made out of the opportunities they had.
81H|USCLASS8|All in all, I think social differences in this country are justified.
